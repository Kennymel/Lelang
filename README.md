Grammar Rules:
Variable Assignment is still the same:
 ex. X = 5
 
Conditional blocks are now:
nothing is given, everything is earned x < 10
…
you are my sunshine

Loop Blocks are now:
goat i <= 5
…
strive for greatness

Print statement is:
It’s our ball ain’t it “…”

To increment:
king me x

To end program:
smiling through it all, can’t believe this my life

Some special cases such as
fizzbuzz: has a built in function named "lakers"
